        Pictionary is a charades-inspired word-guessing game invented by Robert
        Angel with graphic design by Gary Everson and first published in 1985 by
        Angel Games Inc. Angel Games licensed Pictionary to Western Publishing.
        Hasbro purchased the rights in 1994 after acquiring the games business
        of Western Publishing. Mattel acquired ownership of Pictionary in 2001.
        The game is played in teams with players trying to identify specific
        words from their teammates.
